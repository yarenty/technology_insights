End-to-end typesafe APIs made easy


🧙‍♂️  Automatic typesafety
Automatic typesafety & autocompletion inferred from your API-paths, their input data, & outputs.

🍃  Light & Snappy DX
No code generation, run-time bloat, or build pipeline. Zero dependencies & a tiny client-side footprint.

🐻  Add to existing brownfield project
Easy to add to your existing brownfield project with adapters for Connect/Express/Next.js.

@trpc/client depends on some babel runtime helpers + that a fetch() polyfill/ponyfill is used if the browser doesn't support it. @trpc/react is built on top of react-query.
