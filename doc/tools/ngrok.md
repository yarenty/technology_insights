# NGrok - Free Firewall Tunnel



https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup



If you are hosting a server on a home network with a dynamic IP address, it can be hard or impossible to accept incoming web requests. NGrok provides local workstations with a *.ngrok.io web address for exposing local servers to the Internet. It also provides HTTPS/TLS support, which is pretty cool!

Ngrok is especially useful when you want to experiment with third-party APIs that use WebHooks.


to run:
```shell
ngrok http 80
```
