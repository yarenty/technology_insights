VM.Standard.A1.Flex shape (Arm-based Ampere A1 Compute): Because the VM.Standard.A1.Flex shape is a flexible shape, you can customize the number of OCPUs and amount of memory that are allocated when you create or resize an instance. You can use all of the Always Free OCPUs and memory to create a single instance, or create multiple smaller instances that each use a portion of the resources.

Processor: 4 OCPUs total, which you can allocate flexibly
Memory: 24 GB total, which you can allocate flexibly
Networking: The network bandwidth and number of VNICs scale proportionately with the number of OCPUs. For details, see Flexible Shapes.
Image: Your choice of one of the following Always Free-eligible images:

Oracle Linux Cloud Developer

Oracle Linux Cloud Developer provides the latest development tools, languages and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure software development kits (SDKs) to rapidly launch a comprehensive development environment. The Oracle Linux Cloud Developer image requires at least 8 GB of memory.

Oracle Linux
Ubuntu
For steps to create an Always Free-eligible compute instance, see Tutorial - Launching Your First Linux Instance.

 Tip

The Linux images labeled "Always Free Eligible" in the Console are compatible with Always Free compute instances and incur no licensing fees. These images are also compatible with paid resources and are available to users of paid accounts. To provision a compute instance with an image that is not Always Free-eligible, you must have a paid account or a Free Trial account with available credits.
Block Volume
All tenancies receive a total of 200 GB of Block Volume storage, and five volume backups included in the Always Free resources. These amounts apply to both boot volumes and block volumes combined. When you provision a compute instance, the instance automatically receives a 50 GB boot volume for storage. You can also create and attach block volumes to expand the storage capacity of a compute instance. For more information, see Creating a Volume and Attaching a Volume.

Object and Archive Storage
All tenancies get a total of 20 GB of Always Free Object Storage.

Vault
All master encryption keys protected by software are free. All tenancies get 20 key versions of master encryption keys protected by a hardware security module (HSM) and 150 Always Free Vault secrets. You can spread these keys or secrets across any number of vaults in the tenancy, although virtual private vaults are not included in the Always Free resources.

Resource Manager
All tenancies get a set of Always Free resources in the Resource Manager service that allow you to automate the process of provisioning infrastructure using Terraform. See Quickly Launch Your Always Free Resources Using Resource Manager for instructions on using Resource Manager to create your Always Free resources.

Database
All tenancies get two Always Free Oracle Autonomous Databases. You can use these databases for transaction processing, data warehousing, Oracle APEX application development, or JSON-based application development. For current regional availability, see the Always Free Cloud Services table in Cloud Regionsâ€”Infrastructure and Platform Services.

All tenancies also get an Oracle NoSQL Database with up to 133 million reads per month, 133 million writes per month, and 3 tables with 25 GB storage per table. Learn more about Oracle NoSQL Database.
