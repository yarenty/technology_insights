# Plotters

https://crates.io/crates/plotters


Plotters is drawing library designed for rendering figures, plots, and charts, in pure rust. Plotters supports various types of back-ends, including bitmap, vector graph, piston window, GTK/Cairo and WebAssembly.

A new Plotters Developer's Guide is working in progress. The preview version is available at here.
To try Plotters with interactive Jupyter notebook, or view here for the static HTML version.
To view the WASM example, go to this link
Currently we have all the internal code ready for console plotting, but a console based backend is still not ready. See this example for how to plotting on Console with a customized backend.
Plotters now moved all backend code to sperate repositories, check FAQ list for details
Some interesting demo projects are available, feel free to try them out.
