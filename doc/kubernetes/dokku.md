# Dokku
The smallest PaaS implementation you've ever seen
Dokku helps you build and manage the lifecycle of applications

Dokku offers many of the features seen in “Platform-as-a-Service” offerings such as Heroku. Unlike many PaaS offerings, you can host it on a cheap VPS service (like Vultr).

Although it is well suited for hobby projects, it’s important to note that Dokku also works wonderfully in production settings.

With Dokku, you can self host a push-to-deploy mechanism for your hobby project and not waste time with server configs. There are lots of community plugins that handle the most common use-cases.
