## What is Apache Pulsar?
Apache Pulsar is a cloud-native, multi-tenant, high-performance solution for server-to-server messaging and queuing built on the publisher-subscribe (pub-sub) pattern. Pulsar combines the best features of a traditional messaging system like RabbitMQ with those of a pub-sub system like Apache Kafka â€“ scaling up or down dynamically without downtime. It's used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, microservices, instant messaging, data integrations, and more.

## Pulsar Features
### Cloud-native

A multiple layer approach separating compute from storage to work with cloud infrastructures and Kubernetes.

### Serverless functions

Write serverless functions with developer-friendly APIs to natively process data immediately upon arrival. No need to run your own stream processing engine.

### Horizontally scalable

Expand capacity seamlessly to hundreds of nodes.

### Low latency with durability

Low publish latency (< 5ms) at scale with strong durability guarantees.

### Geo-replication

Configurable replication between data centers across multiple geographic regions.

### Multi-tenancy

Built from the ground up as a multi-tenant system. Supports isolation, authentication, authorization, and quotas.

### Persistent storage

Persistent message storage based on Apache BookKeeper. IO-level isolation between write, and read operations.

### Client libraries

Flexible messaging models with high-level APIs for Java, Go, Python, C++, Node.js, WebSocket and C#.

### Operability

REST Admin API for provisioning, administration, tools and monitoring. Can be deployed on bare metal, Kubernetes, Amazon Web Services(AWS), and DataCenter Operating System(DC/OS).

## Pulsar Users
Run in production at scale with millions of messages per second across millions of topics, Pulsar is now used by thousands of companies for real-time workloads.
