# Druid

Apache Druid is a real-time database to power modern analytics applications.

## Install

Download:
https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/index.html


## Start 

```bash
./bin/start-micro-quickstart
```


http://localhost:8888/unified-console.html



### cleaning

Remember that after stopping Druid services, you can start clean next time by deleting the var directory from the Druid root directory and running the bin/start-micro-quickstart script again. You will likely want to do this before taking other data ingestion tutorials, since in them you will create the same wikipedia datasource.
