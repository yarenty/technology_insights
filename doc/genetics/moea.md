# The MOEA Framework


MOEAFramework-2.13-Source


The MOEA Framework is a free and open source Java library for developing and
experimenting with multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and other
general-purpose multiobjective optimization algorithms. The MOEA Framework
supports genetic algorithms, differential evolution, particle swarm
optimization, genetic programming, grammatical evolution, and more. A number of
algorithms are provided out-of-the-box, including NSGA-II, NSGA-III, Îµ-MOEA,
GDE3 and MOEA/D. In addition, the MOEA Framework provides the tools necessary
to rapidly design, develop, execute and statistically test optimization
algorithms.

Its key features includes:
* Fast, reliable implementations of many state-of-the-art algorithms
* Extensible with custom algorithms, problems and operators
* Supports master-slave, island-model, and hybrid parallelization
* Modular design for constructing new algorithms from existing components
* Permissive open source license
* Fully documented source code
* Over 1200 test cases to ensure validity
