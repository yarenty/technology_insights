A Digital Twin is a virtual representation of a physical object or system from the real world in the digital world; or in other words, it serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or system. It is irrelevant whether the physical object or system already exists in the real world or will exist in the future.

Digital Twins are updated from real-time data, and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help decision-making. Especially in industry digital twin simulations will enable the next era of industrial virtualization and AI.
