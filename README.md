# Technology Insights

List of technologies which, till now, I kept as open tabs on my browser as "to investigate/ to read/ to do ...", and never really have time to do so.

Procedure:
- spent 5 min for investigation - copy materials
- spent 5 min for "summary", how/and what can I do with it
- clean my tabs! ;-)




## Projects

- [MindsDB](doc/mindsdb.adoc)
  - machine learning inside DB 
  - integrates with: mysql, postgressql, kafka, cassandra, mongo , redis, oracle, sql server
  - few nice use cases, can run on docker, to be used => maybe in some production type scenario - early prevention ...
